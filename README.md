# LiveStreamingDashboard

## Adaptive Engagement Intelligence Platform for Live Streaming

Live streaming platforms require real-time intelligence to understand viewer behavior, predict engagement patterns, and optimize streaming experiences. This project develops a behavioral analytics framework specifically designed for live streaming environments that dynamically analyzes viewer interactions, identifies engagement risks, and enables proactive content and audience management strategies.

## What it does:
- Segments viewers by real-time behavioral data (watch time, chat activity, interaction patterns)
- Predicts viewer churn and engagement drops during live streams
- Enables targeted retention strategies for streamers and platform operators
- Powers a live dashboard with real-time anomaly detection for streaming metrics
- Analyzes chat sentiment and viewer participation patterns

## Key Strategic Benefits:
- Real-time streaming experience optimization
- Predictive viewer engagement intelligence
- Intelligent content recommendation and timing
- Personalized viewer retention with high impact
- Stream performance analytics and insights

## Project Structure:
- **data/** - Streaming datasets, viewer databases, chat logs, and engagement metrics
- **ui/** - Real-time dashboard components and streaming analytics interface
- **models/** - Machine learning models for viewer behavior prediction (saved as pickle/joblib files)
- **features/** - Feature engineering pipelines for streaming data and viewer segmentation

## Getting Started
To set up the environment and install dependencies, run:

```bash
./initialisation.sh
```

This will check your Python version, create and activate a virtual environment, and install all required packages.
